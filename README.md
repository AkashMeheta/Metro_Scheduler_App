# React + Vite
This Project is not Complete YET. I have to upload the full time table and also implements REDUX for state management.
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


<h1>Problems: </h1>

1) The first problem That I faced is Storing all Schedules in a array of object in such a manaer which could become easy to workwith.
2) Next is I coudln't find any API so I have to write those objects with by hands BUT then I realize that I am a software engineering so I develope a JS code which takes all data from a static website which creates those 104 object with 8 key value pairs in a sec..
3) Manage two different array one for UP sides metro and one for DOWN sides metros with only one input section. A little conditional redering should do the job.
